## 📖 Overview

Smart Consumption Insights processes time-series consumption data to:

* Detect usage patterns (daily/seasonal)
* Identify consumption peaks and anomalies
* Provide recommendations to optimize usage

Ideal for energy providers, facility managers, or homeowners aiming to reduce waste and costs.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Time-Series Analysis** (e.g., rolling averages, seasonality detection)
* **Anomaly Detection** (e.g., threshold-based, statistical methods)
* **Usage Profiling** (peak vs off-peak behavior, user clustering)
* **Interactive Visualizations** with plots and dashboards

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**

  * `pandas`, `numpy` — data ingestion & processing
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` — static & interactive visuals
  * `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `prophet` — forecasting & modeling
* (Optional) **Jupyter Notebooks** / **Streamlit** — exploratory & interactive use

---

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Data Collection**
   Load structured time-series datasets (e.g., CSV, APIs)

2. **Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing or irregular intervals
   * Normalize usage scales & resample to fixed frequency

3. **Exploration & Visualization**

   * Plot trends over days/weeks/months
   * Decompose signals into seasonal & trend components

4. **Analysis**

   * Detect spikes or under-usage
   * Forecast future consumption
   * Cluster similar user behavior

5. **Insights & Reporting**

   * Annotate anomalies
   * Generate usage reports (daily/weekly/monthly)
   * Suggest reduction strategies

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KardamSinghal/SmartConsumptionInsights.git
cd SmartConsumptionInsights
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare data

* Add your consumption `.csv` files into `data/`
* Ensure date/time column and consumption values are correctly formatted

### 4. Launch analysis

Run notebooks in `notebooks/` or start the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run dashboards/consumption_dashboard.py
```

---

## 📊 Results & Visualizations

* Time-series charts showing daily/weekly trends
* Decomposed visualizations (trend, seasonality, residuals)
* Anomaly labels and consumption breakdown plots

Refer to `results/` for sample outputs.

---

## 🔮 Future Work

* Integrate real-time data pipelines
* Add smart alerting for threshold breaches
* Incorporate weather or tariff data for correlation analysis
* Expand dashboard features with user login and historical comparisons
